# react-leaflet-maps

I created this pared back version of my final [Ski Resort Finder](https://scottpdawson.com/how-to-create-interactive-maps-with-react-and-leaflet/) project as a resource for anyone wanting to do this on their own. Feel free to fork the repo and use it as a basis for your own map development.
